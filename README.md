A simple blog engine, built from scratch (hey, we'll never have enough blog engines).
First intended as an exercise to test out some technologies. It runs my own blog http://postback.be (mostly Dutch) on Azure.

Things to to
- redirect some old url's (a redirect config file?)
- search posts and users when pressing 'search' button
- clearly label or colour posts published in the future
- Plugin image picker in editor to fetch stuff from azure blob storage
- Cache content actions
- Finish the design of the blog itself (tags, details page, paging)
- Dahsboard with statsd (?) or dashing on dashboard for statistics, logs, errors
- tinymce: better (or a basic bootstrap wysiwyg editor)
