A simple blog engine, built from scratch (hey, we'll never have enough blog engines).
This one's mainly started for:
- getting my fingers dirty with MVC 3
- practicing that github thang
- learning MongoDB
- and learning MongoDB using NoRM

Things to to
- Move from MongoDB to RavenDB
- In the content overview in the admin, add Publish by date
- In the post detail view & overview: show publish date or created date
- Actually: publish date is created, when it's not being set
- Vertical line next to post should be better alligned
- Convert dates to UTC and parse them back on the front-end
