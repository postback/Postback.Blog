A simple blog engine, built from scratch (hey, we'll never have enough blog engines).
This one's mainly started for:
- getting my fingers dirty with MVC 3
- practicing that github thang
- learning MongoDB
- and learning MongoDB using NoRM

Things to to
- Created is changed, eventhough i'm updating
- Actually: publish date should be created, when it's not being specifically set
- Vertical line next to post should be better alligned
- Convert everything to ServiceLocator
- Fix ravendb embedded unit tests + appharbor
