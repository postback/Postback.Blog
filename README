A simple blog engine, built from scratch (hey, we'll never have enough blog engines).
First intended as an exercise to test out some technologies. It runs my own blog http://postback.be (mostly Dutch) on AppHarbor.

Things to to
- Convert everything to ServiceLocator
- Plugin image picker in editor to fetch stuff from amazon
- Cache content actions
- Redeisng front-end a bit (tags, details page, paging)
